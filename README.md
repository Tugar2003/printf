37. The big print gives and the small print takes away
Handle the following flag characters for non-custom conversion specifiers

00. I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life
Write a function that produces output according to a format.

10. The negative is the equivalent of the composer's score, and the print the performance

11. It's depressing when you're still around and your albums are out of print
